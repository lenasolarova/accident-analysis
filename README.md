# Readme for the language comparison project

## Chosen languages
I have chosen to work with Python an C because of their vast differences - more on this topic is included in the **report** part of this project.

### Python
To run the python script, it is recommended to enter into a virtual environment using: 
```source /LIC25_PCOM7E/.venv/bin/activate```,
there you can install the requirements using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` and finally run the file using the CLI (see ```python main.py --help``` for all options).
